# Potential Impacts of 5ft Sea Level Rise on Atlantic City, New Jersey<br/>
## Jonathan DeLura, Rutgers University

It was predicted with 17% confidence by the [2019 STAP Report](https://climatechange.rutgers.edu/resources/climate-change-and-new-jersey/nj-sea-level-rise-reports), that the Atlantic Ocean would rise by 5ft by the year 2100 along the New Jersey Coast. The following pdf maps and interactive map, created by Jonathan DeLura, as a final project for Command Line GIS, offered as part of the Master of Public Informatics program at the Rutgers University Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, visualize the potential impact of this Sea Level Rise (SLR) on the tax base and some of the critical infrastucture in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
